- have been having problems with space and wandb, lots of runs have been crashing, slowed progress alot
    - everyone has been having problems, being sorted DONE (errors persisit just wait)
- i have safety violations logging, messed up video recorder, step/timestep problem, should be done by next week (see most recent runs on wandb)
    - just fix recorder (DONE) and see if i can log type of vioolations (like the seperate constaraints) (DONE)
- found paper on optimal ppo robot arm control - should i use them and compare performance?
    - yes, lets see how much better it performs (DONE)
- handover is working again, also experimented with extendied training, see model so far (already started woirking from lowering penalty, threshold point will be interesting)
- on extended version, didnt retreat and place object, worth putting more time into it to get that to work? handover did work though, potnentialy could work by lowering dropping penalty/even more time
    - give it a day or two, see if it works (TODO)
- pickup is sorted, need to run extended version to see if it translates to handover, see model so far
    - just do above (TODO)


TODO - try run new reward 14 on normal with no violations for both, and run 13 on pickup, then run pickup furhter, then do above

DO 0 and 20 - remove 0,25 and 0,5
On success rates do it over more runs - and log violations with it
